            <p>The JavaScript Guide shows you how to use JavaScript and gives an overview of the language. If you need exhaustive information about a language feature, have a look at the JavaScript reference.
                <br>
                <br>
                This Guide is divided into the following chapters.

            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced
                server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files
                (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example,
                a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>  
            <br>
            <br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser 
                        and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                        on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>

                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript

            <br>
            <p>
                This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
                likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.

            <header>javascript and java</header>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles
                Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which
                was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of
                data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
                common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
                You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance,
                that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes.
                Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong 
                typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE.
                These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in
                functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and
                communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized,
                international programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the
                same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation 
                of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about different
                versions of JavaScript and ECMAScript specification editions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262. You can also find
                the specification on the Ecma International website. The ECMAScript specification does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM), which is standardized by the
                World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). The DOM defines the way in which HTML document
                objects are exposed to your script. To get a better idea about the different technologies that are used when programming
                with JavaScript, consult the article JavaScript technologies overview.

                <h3>JavaScript documentation versus the ECMAScript specification</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript.
                It is useful if you want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or
                 engine (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                 The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers.
                 Use the JavaScript documentation for information when writing scripts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may
                be unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript,
                the language itself remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript programmer.

            <br>
            <br>
                <p> Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser.
                    This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest
                    versions of Firefox, so using the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> 
                The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript;
                you can use it into two modes: single-line input mode, and multi-line input mode.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Single-line input in the Web Console</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web
                page, and also includes a JavaScript interpreter that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To open the Web Console (Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows and Linux or
                    Cmd-Option-K on Mac), open the Tools menu in Firefox, and select "Developer ▶ Web Console".
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName)
                      }
                      console.log(eval('3 + 5')) 
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Multi-line input in the Web Console</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The single-line input mode of the Web Console is great for quick testing of JavaScript expressions,
                but although you can execute multiple lines,
                it's not very convenient for that. For more complex JavaScript, you can use the multi-line line input mode.
                </p>

                But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict";
                before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. The strict mode
                and IIFE articles explain what those do, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:

                    Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.
                Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another
                (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).

            <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>var</strong> Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>let</strong>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong>const</strong>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
                
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                
                You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
                
                Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Declaring variables</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in two ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local
                            and global variables, depending on the execution context.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be
                             used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>

                    You can declare variables to unpack values from Object Literals using the Destructuring Assignment syntax. For example, let { bar } = foo. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the
                     value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>You can also assign a value to a variable For example, x = 42. This form creates an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to
                     unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.

                    A variable declared using the var or let statement with no
                    assigned value specified has the value of undefined.

                    An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a
